DEVELOPMENT TASK: Build Vanilla JavaScript Foundation
Based on your pattern extraction analysis, implement Phase 1 of the FitnessWise rebuild using vanilla JavaScript.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Zero data loss during workout sessions
Sub-100ms response to touch interactions
Reliable 30-second auto-save with retry logic
Works flawlessly during physical exertion

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:

Create Basic HTML Structure
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <div id="day-banner" data-component="day-banner"></div>
    <div id="workout-banner" data-component="workout-banner"></div>
  </div>
  <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Implement WorkoutStateManager (from your analysis)

Use the exact retry logic and save queue pattern you designed
Include localStorage backup for immediate reliability
Implement the singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances


Build Three-Banner Components

AppBanner: Fixed header with authentication status
DayBanner: Progressive disclosure with optimized scroll handling
WorkoutBanner: Touch-optimized exercise tracking


Create Event Delegation System

Single click handler with action mapping
Proper preventDefault for touch events
44px minimum touch targets for all interactive elements


Implement Timer System

Use Web Workers for accuracy (as you recommended)
Persistent state across phone calls and app switching
Horizontal button layout that works during workouts



FILE STRUCTURE TO CREATE:
Use the exact structure from your analysis:

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

Test touch interactions on mobile devices
Verify auto-save works during network interruptions
Ensure timer state survives phone calls
Validate workout progress persists across browser refresh

OUTPUT: Complete working foundation that I can test immediately on my phone during a real workout session.
