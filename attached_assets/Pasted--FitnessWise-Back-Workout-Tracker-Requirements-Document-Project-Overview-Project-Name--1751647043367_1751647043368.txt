## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Event Handling Architecture
```javascript
// Use event delegation, NOT onclick handlers
document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  const action = event.target.dataset.action;
  const handler = actionHandlers[action];
  if (handler) {
    handler(event);
  }
});

const actionHandlers = {
  'start-timer': startTimer,
  'complete-set': completeSet,
  'navigate-exercise': navigateExercise
};
```

### Component Organization
```javascript
// Clean module separation
import { FirebaseService } from './services/firebase.js';
import { TimerComponent } from './components/timer.js';
import { WorkoutTracker } from './components/workout.js';
import { NavigationManager } from './components/navigation.js';

class FitnessApp {
  constructor() {
    this.firebase = new FirebaseService();
    this.timer = new TimerComponent();
    this.workout = new WorkoutTracker();
    this.navigation = new NavigationManager();
  }
}
```

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
class AppState {
  constructor() {
    this.currentWorkout = null;
    this.timerState = { running: false, elapsed: 0 };
    this.userSession = { authenticated: false, user: null };
    this.saveInterval = 30000; // 30 seconds
  }

  persistState() {
    localStorage.setItem('fitnesswise-state', JSON.stringify(this.getState()));
    this.syncToFirebase();
  }

  restoreState() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('fitnesswise-state');
    if (saved) {
      this.setState(JSON.parse(saved));
    }
  }
}
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Scope Pollution Prevention
- **NEVER use onclick handlers** - they create scope pollution with ES6 modules
- **Use event delegation** for all user interactions
- **Organize code in ES6 modules** with clean import/export patterns
- **Avoid global function bridges** - they create maintenance nightmares

### Firebase Integration Best Practices
- **Separate configuration** from application logic
- **Handle all error states** with user-friendly messages
- **Implement offline-first** approach with local storage fallback
- **Use Firestore security rules** to protect user data

### Mobile Testing Requirements
- **Test on actual devices** - browser responsive mode is insufficient
- **Verify touch interactions** work with various finger sizes
- **Test during simulated exercise** (timer accuracy, state persistence)
- **Validate across iOS Safari and Android Chrome**

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Indicators
- **Zero data loss** due to accidental refreshes
- **Sub-100ms response** to user interactions
- **Successful state restoration** after browser crashes
