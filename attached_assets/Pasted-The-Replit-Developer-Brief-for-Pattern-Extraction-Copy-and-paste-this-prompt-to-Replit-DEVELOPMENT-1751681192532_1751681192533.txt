DEVELOPMENT TASK: Pattern Extraction Analysis
I need you to analyze the existing FitnessWise codebase and create a comprehensive Pattern Extraction Document that identifies valuable design patterns for rebuilding the application using vanilla JavaScript instead of React.
SPECIFIC DELIVERABLES:

Component Analysis Report

Examine each React component (App.js, TimerButtons.js, WorkoutDisplay.js, etc.)
For each component, identify:

What architectural concept it represents
What user experience pattern it implements
How the concept could translate to vanilla JavaScript
What functionality is missing vs. what's actually implemented




Technology Stack Comparison Matrix

Create a table comparing React implementation vs. vanilla JavaScript requirements
Identify which patterns from React components can be preserved
Highlight which implementations need complete rebuilding
Note performance and complexity trade-offs


User Interface Pattern Catalog

Document the three-banner system architecture (App Banner, Day Banner, Workout Banner)
Analyze the progressive disclosure concepts vs. actual implementation
Extract mobile-first design patterns that work
Identify touch interaction patterns that need improvement


State Management Architecture Review

Document how React currently handles state vs. requirements for 30-second auto-save
Analyze Firebase integration patterns vs. actual working implementation
Identify data persistence patterns that can be preserved
Highlight gaps between claimed functionality and actual code


Migration Strategy Recommendations

For each major component, provide specific recommendations for vanilla JavaScript conversion
Identify which files/patterns should be preserved vs. rebuilt
Create priority order for rebuilding components
Suggest specific ES6 module patterns to replace React components



OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create a comprehensive markdown document with clear sections for each analysis area. Include code examples where relevant. Focus on practical migration guidance rather than theoretical analysis.
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Be brutally honest about implementation gaps vs. claims
Focus on patterns that serve the actual user requirements (workout tracking during physical exertion)
Prioritize reliability and mobile performance over feature complexity
Provide specific technical recommendations, not general observations

CONTEXT:
This analysis will guide a complete application rebuild using vanilla JavaScript, ES6 modules, and modern web standards. The goal is preserving good architectural thinking while fixing fundamental implementation problems.
